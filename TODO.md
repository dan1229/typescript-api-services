## [Unreleased]
-----
### 1.1.0



#### mixed permissions for django?
- i.e., if the `get` doesnt need a token but `post` does



#### improve duplicate catching
- add option to shut off
  - `catchDuplicates` bool
- BIG
  - find a way to include pageUrl
    - middleware or something?
  - some way we can key for `catchDuplicates` better to account for users moving between pages quickly
    - this is really more important than the amount of time, which is now a bit of a hack at only one second
  -
  - could also have it retry if the same pageUrl is hit again?
    - how to prevent just a flurry of calls spaced out by X seconds?



#### move error fields to 'message' when no 'message'?
- if no 'message' field, move some field to 'message'?
- or if default message?
  - how to figure that out?
    - maybe "None" instead of default message...?


#### timeout
- is it working lol?


#### ci
- add build step somehow
  - add nextjs project? idk dont want to limit this to a specific framework


#### still issues with dupes?
- try waiting a few seconds if duplicate is found
  - i believe theres currently a race condition where req 1 isnt returned yet but req 2 is being marked a dupe with no response to send back yet


### [1.1.0] - 2024-MM-DD
#### TODO
